      <h2>Why AltSchool</h2>
      <article>
        <p>
          I chose to join AltSchool Africa to learn Backend Engineering because
          I believe it is the best place for me to grow my skills and become a
          better developer. I have been learning on my own through YouTube,
          Udemy, and other online platforms, but I now want a more structured
          and practical learning experience. AltSchool Africa, especially with
          the support from the Bybit Academy Fund, offers a chance to learn from
          experts and work on real-world projects. This will help me move from
          being self-taught to becoming a skilled and confident backend
          engineer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Backend Engineering interests me because it powers everything behind a
          digital product. I want to understand how to build strong systems,
          manage databases, and create secure APIs—skills that are very
          important in fintech and other industries. I believe that by gaining
          these skills at AltSchool Africa, I can help create better technology
          solutions for Africa, especially in areas like financial inclusion. I
          am excited to learn, grow, and work with others who share the same
          passion.
